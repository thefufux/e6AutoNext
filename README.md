# E6 Auto Next
Simple software to automatically switch to the following posts for use in hands free.

# Why ?
Imagine, you are playing solo and you lack a little imagination. You then go to your favorite site via your phone or your PC to get inspired. You then spend a pleasant moment in front of your favorite video, but woe! Your video is finished... You would like to move on to another one, but you are a little too busy and your hands slip a little too much. In addition, you do not want to dirty your equipment! Next time, you will install "E6 Auto Next": you will prepare your search in advance and you will let it do its job! And presto, no more gaming sessions with a dirty phone or PC!
